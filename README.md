## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm an AI & DS engineering student with a passion for blending machine learning, full-stack web development, and creative problem-solving.

💻 I love building projects that combine:
- 🤖 AI & ML models (NLP, Computer Vision, Predictive models)
- 🌐 Web technologies (React, Django, FastAPI, Flask)
- 🛠️ Blockchain basics (Ethereum, smart contracts)  
- 📊 Financial & Quantitative research (Fast Expression Alpha models)

✨ I'm always exploring new tech, from RAG pipelines to deploying ML models, and from intuitive UIs to decentralized apps.

### 📂 File Handle
> A Django + React app for file management with authentication, category filtering, and a slick UI.

### 💹 Fast Expression Alphas
> Built alpha models for top 3000 US stocks with delay 1 using expert FEL operators.
